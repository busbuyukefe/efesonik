# efesonik (v2)

A directional soundbar proof-of-concept using cheap 40kHz transducers.

This project can work with the code from [gururise](https://github.com/gururise/directional_speaker) and uses the STM32-bluepill library of [yet-another-average-joe](https://github.com/yet-another-average-joe/Kicad-STM32)

On the [PDF](https://github.com/busbuyukefe/efesonik/blob/main/Parametrik%20Hoparl%C3%B6r.pdf) you can find my notes about the price, working principle and things like layout of the transducers I took while planning/designing the project.

This system has a set of parametric-speaker arranged side-by-side with independent angle control for each one. This allows the system to be focused on more than one targets thus making a more usable. With each section being able to rotate independently it takes less space with the rotating-mechanism than a single speaker with a gimbal.

You can see the code I used in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/busbuyukefe/7ff0d10a8e1e2d5ed5e22a36067409bf) I posted quite a while ago (Which is essentialy the same code from gururise but with a different pinout)

In the amp section of the block diagram you can use anything else to handle the switching. 
The KiCAD drawing has a single sided PCB design but I didn't had the time to check if it is working.

## I sold this project to someone around March of 2021 so I no longer have it.
